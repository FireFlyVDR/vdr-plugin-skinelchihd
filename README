Description:

This plugin for Klaus Schmidinger's Video Disc Recorder VDR adds the "Elchi HD"
skin. It is based on the Elchi skin with major refactoring to make use of newer
VDR features like True Color support.


Requirements:
-------------
VDR  2.4.3+
ImageMagick++ 7.x or GraphicsMagick++
for SVG channel logos ImageMagick++ is required


Features:
---------
- True Color Support
- shaded surface look
- SD, HD and UHD Support (OSD, Channel Logos, Video stream info)
- SVG channel logo support (True Color, scaled to required OSD resolution)
- EPG image support (True Color) for EPG and recordings
- displays type of recording in Recordings Menu (HD, UHD)
- multithreaded scrolling and image loading
- if VDR is recording a REC symbols is displayed highlighted in red and white the channel display and replay display
- if VDR is cutting or moving recordings a scissor symbols is highlighted in the channel display and replay display

Installation
------------
The skinElchiHD plugin is compiled and installed the same way as any other plugin:
- cd <VDR>/PLUGINS/src
- tar xf vdr-skinelchihd-<version>.tar.bz2
- ln -s skinelchihd-<version> skinelchihd
- cd ../..
- make plugins  [IMAGELIB=graphicsmagick]

Append "IMAGELIB=imagemagick" or "IMAGELIB=graphicsmagick" to themake command to build with the respective library. 
Default (e.g. witout parameter) is ImageMagick++.

Copy the provided 50-skinelchihd.conf file to your VDR args dir (e.g. /etc/vdr/conf.d)
and adapt it if required or use the parameters on the VDR commandline.

Copy the theme files in the themes subdirectory to the VDR theme directory
  <configdir>/themes 


Usage:
------
Channel logos:
For displaying channel logos skinElchiHD requires SVG logo files. SkinElchiHD
does not provide logo files but there are several sets floating around in the
internet. The logos should have no background (=transparent) as it is added by
skinElchiHD.

The path to the logo files can be set with a command line parameter: 

  -l <LogoPath>,  --logopath=<LogoPath>     path to PNG and SVG channel logos
                                            (default: <ResourceDir>/plugins/skinelchihd/logos)
For displaying SVG channel logos ImagMagick++ is required.

Images of EPG and recordings: 
SkinElchiHD can display EPG images in JPEG format for both EPG view and recordings.
The path to EPG images can be set with:
  -e <EPGImageDir>, --epgimages=<ImageDir>  path to EPG images
                                            (default: <CacheDir>/plugins/skinelchihd/epgimages)

For the EPG the images need to follow the format "<SOURCE>_<EPGID>[_<No].jpg" 
where <SOURCE> is the DVB source (e.g. S19.2E-1-1019-10301) and <EPGID> the ID
of the EPG event. If there is more than one image then for the second and 
further images an ascending Number <No> beginning with '1' is appended and
skinElchiHD can display up to 5 images sequentially. The time until the next
images is dispalyed can be set via OSD in the Setup of the plugin.

For recording images they have to reside in the folder of the recording and
need to end with ".jpg".

  write a message (found / not found) for each requested channel logo in the syslog
  this can be helpful to find missing logos or to verify the logopath  


Tips & Hints:
-------------
- use a script like vdr_copy_epimage.sh with VDR's '--record' parameter to copy
  the EPG images in the recording folder directly after it has been created
- to convert SVG channel logs to png (including the links) call the following script in the channel logo folder:

!/bin/bash
#
# convert all SVG files and links in the current directory to png
  
OLDIFS=$IFS
IFS=$'\n'

for svgfile in $(find . -iname "*.svg" -type f);
do
   pngfile=${svgfile%%.svg}.png
   if [ ! -e "$pngfile" ]; then
      echo "converting $svgfile -> $pngfile"
      convert -background none "$svgfile" "$pngfile"
   fi
done

for lnk in $(find . -lname "*.svg" );
do
   source="$(basename -s "svg" $lnk)png"
   target=$(realpath --relative-to=. "$lnk")
   target="${target%%.svg}.png"
   if [ ! -e "$source" ]; then
      echo "symlinking $source -> $target"
      ln -s "${target}" "${source}"
   fi
done
IFS=$OLDIFS
