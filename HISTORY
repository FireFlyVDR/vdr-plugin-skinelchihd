VDR Plugin 'skinelchiHD' Revision History
----------------------------------------

2020-08-22 Version 0.5.0
- initial release of skinElchiHD

2020-09-11 Version 0.5.1
- limited scrolling pixmap to MaxPixmapSize() (reported by mamomoz @VDR-Portal)
- fixed plugin path in 50-skinelchihd.conf (thanks to Dr. Seltsam @VDR-Portal)
- added support for PNG channel logos, select in the plugin channel settings if the search starts with SVG or PNG (suggested by mamomoz @VDR-Portal)
- added support for channel logo names with upper/lower case like the channel name appears in channels.conf (suggested by mamomoz @VDR-Portal)
- added selectable larger logo size (suggested by Uwe @VDR-Portal)
- fixed initialisation of marks in replay dialog (reported by lnj @VDR-Portal)
- fixed deadlock in replay
- minor code cleanup
- added support for GraphicsMagick++ as alternative for ImageMagick++. Select graphicsmagick or imagemagick by setting IMAGELIB 
  in the Makefile or add IMAGELIB=... as parameter to make. As GraphicsMagick cannot read SVG properly only PNG channel 
  logos are available with GraphicsMagick++
- dropped support for IamgeMagick++ 6.x as it has problems with transparency which won't be solved. So for ImageMAGick++ version 7.x is required
  (thanks to Uwe @vdrportal.de for testing v6 and v7)
- fixed cutting symbol darkness
- made HD/UHD logo in front of recordings optional
